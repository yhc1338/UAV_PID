# UAV_PID
uav by using the double-loop pid control

The kinematic model of uav is covered in fly.m which is an second derivative model.
The inputs of the four propellers is listed in fm.m. And the parameters of the pid need to be retried when uses the model of "+".
PID_fly.m is the controler of the double-loop.
showUAV.m is used to show the pose.
